REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret_here

# OAuth Configuration  
# The following are automatically constructed from PORT
# Only set these if you need to override the defaults
# OAUTH_ISSUER=http://localhost:3000
# REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/oauth/reddit/callback

# Reddit API Identity Configuration
# IMPORTANT: These identify your APPLICATION to Reddit, not the end users
# Reddit requires a specific User-Agent format for all API requests
# Format: <platform>:<app_id>:<version> (by /u/<developer_reddit_username>)
# Example: linux:my-reddit-app:v1.0.0 (by /u/my_developer_account)
# Note: The username should be YOUR (the developer's) Reddit account, not end users
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=YourApp:v1.0.0 (by /u/YourRedditUsername)

# Your Reddit developer account username (without /u/ prefix)
# This is used to construct the User-Agent string for API compliance
# It should be the Reddit account that registered the OAuth app
REDDIT_USERNAME=your-reddit-username
